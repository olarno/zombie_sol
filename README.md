Library : 
OpenZeppelin is a library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts that you can use in your own DApps. After this lesson, we highly recommend you check out their site to further your learning!



## Gas notion
In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called gas. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.

How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a gas cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total gas cost of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions â€” and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

32 bits is more than enough to hold the zombie's level and timestamp, so this will save us some gas costs by packing the data more tightly than using a regular uint (256-bits).

## Let's recap:
We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
We've learned to protect core functions with onlyOwner
We've learned about gas and gas optimization
We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets above a certain level
And finally, we now have a function to return a user's zombie army
